## Sh0r7

almost like URL shortening for data 

roughly based on idea from [https://www.eddywm.com/lets-build-a-url-shortener-in-go/](https://www.eddywm.com/lets-build-a-url-shortener-in-go/)

#### TODO:
- [x] metric version
- [ ] css mobile for info page
- [ ] global metrics to db
- [ ] lock non global changes
- [ ] use mem lock on shorts (lock indication)


- [ ] other short we like - short budddies... 
    - blinkist, movie summerizer...
- [ ] short audio
    - pod faster... ?
